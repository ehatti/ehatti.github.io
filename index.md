Hello! My name is Eashan Hatti, and I'm currently a CS undergrad at Yale University. I'm primarily interested in PL, particularly semantics and formal verification. You can reach me at `<first>.<last>@yale.edu`.

**Public Notes**

You can read my notes [here](forest/output/index.xml). They're written using Jon Sterling's [Forester](https://sr.ht/~jonsterling/forester/) tool.

**Projects**:

- [LHL](https://github.com/ehatti/LHL): LHL is the first sound and complete program logic for _compositional linearizability_ [[Oliveira et al, 2024](https://flint.cs.yale.edu/flint/publications/ctlinear-jacm.pdf)], which is a generalization of atomic linearizability, set linearizability, and interval linearizability. This makes it complete for concurrent objects -- any interval-linearizable object (and thus _any_ concurrent object) may be verified in this system.
