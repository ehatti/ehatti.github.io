<p>A programming language has to fix an execution strategy. For instance
functional languages can be call-by-value, call-by-name, call-by need,
imperative languages are typically always call-by-value, etc. I’m giving
the call-by- family as a specific example here, but in general your
language just needs some sort of execution semantics</p>
<p>A key property of a good execution semantics is that it makes good
progress. That is to say, it generates infinite loops as rarely as
possible. What does this mean? Consider the following lambda term</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
(\lambda x y. x) \text{finite_value} \text{infinite_loop}
\]</span></p>
<p>We have the function <span class="math inline">\(\lambda x y.
x\)</span>, which takes two arguments and returns the first. We then
apply this function to <span
class="math inline">\(\text{finite_value}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\text{infinite_loop}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using a call-by-value execution strategy, both arguments would first
be executed and then passed to the function. This causes an infinite
loop, because it means that we execute the <span
class="math inline">\(\text{infinite_loop}\)</span> term! We say that in
this case, call-by-value does not make good progress</p>
<p>Now let’s consider a different execution strategy, call-by-name, in
which a term is only executed once it is pattern-matched upon. In this
case, executing the function makes better progress, returning <span
class="math inline">\(\text{finite_value}\)</span>! This is because the
argument is never used, and so a call-by-need strategy will not try to
execute it</p>
<p>Notice how in this case, one evaluation strategy is “worse” than
another in terms of this progress metric in that it allows more useful
programs to execute. For instance Haskell uses call-by-need, which we
may exploit to write weird programs that would only result in infinite
loops in a call-by-value language</p>
<p>Let’s take this back to where we started: Logic programming.</p>
<p>What is logic programming’s execution semantics? The answer is proof
search, where we have a proposition P and attempt to find a proof for P
– P is a logic program. Proof search is extremely badly behaved as a
execution semantics, in terms of the progress metric. It is extremely
undecidable in that most cases outside very tightly-defined domains
quickly result in infinite loops – proof search, out of all the
execution strategies out there, produces some of the most infinite loops
in a practical execution semantics</p>
<p>To alleviate this, logic programs use a very directed form of proof
search that also may be compiled to somewhat efficient code, but these
restrictions cause the language to lose the free-form, undirected,
relational nature that we care about in the first place</p>
<p>Constraint logic programming seeks to improve on this by adding
decidable domains to a bigger logic language. This helps in that it
improve the amount of progress a program may make without compromising
the expressivity of the language, but also means the language is not as
general purpose as functional, imperative, or otherwise languages,
because in order to make different programming tasks feasible in a
manner that is “beautiful” for a logic program you must continually add
different domains to suit that task, if there even exists a decidable
domain for the task. Perhaps it is possible to encode your problem in a
different domain, but then you have encoding overhead (both mental and
efficiency-wise), which is again not an issue in general purpose
languages where you don’t have to ever worry about the progress metric
of your program in the first place</p>
